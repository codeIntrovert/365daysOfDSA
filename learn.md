# Welcome to 90DaysOfDSA! 🚀

Hey there, future problem solvers and coding enthusiasts! Welcome to my GitHub repository, "90DaysOfDSA". Here, we embark on a journey together to dive deep into Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) by solving 90 LeetCode problems over the span of 90 days, all using Java. 📚💻

## What's the Plan?

Every day for the next 90 days, I'll be posting a new LeetCode problem along with its solution in Java. Each day's solution will be neatly organized under the `./src` directory, categorized by days from Day01 to Day90. Within each day's folder, you'll find the LeetCode problem link and its corresponding Java solution. 📝

## Let's Learn Together! 🤓

Learning DSA doesn't have to be intimidating! Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, this repository is for you. Each solution is accompanied by a YouTube short video, where I'll explain the problem and walk you through the thought process behind the solution in just one video per problem. 📹

## Why Java? ☕

Java remains one of the most widely used programming languages in the IT industry. By mastering DSA with Java, you're not only enhancing your problem-solving skills but also positioning yourself for success in job interviews and real-world projects. 🌟

## How You Can Contribute 🌈

If you're passionate about DSA and Java like me, I encourage you to join this journey! Feel free to contribute your own solutions, provide feedback, or suggest improvements. Together, we can create a vibrant community of learners and problem solvers. 🙌
